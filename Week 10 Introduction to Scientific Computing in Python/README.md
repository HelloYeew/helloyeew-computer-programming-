# Numpy class at 30 March 2021

I write [this jupyter notebook](numpy_inclass.ipynb) in class with professer. (Professer use terminal so it's look a little ugly in jupyter notebook)

First I don't want to write it but I capture a screen and [quality is suck](shit_quality_screen_capture.png).

Ps. If you find something wrong, just push to edit it or pull request then I will merge it.
